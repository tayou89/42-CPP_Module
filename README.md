# CPP Module

This repository contains the implementation of C++ modules from 00 to 09, covering various aspects of C++ programming.

## Overview

The CPP Module project is designed to introduce Object-Oriented Programming concepts using C++. Each module focuses on different aspects of the language, progressively increasing in complexity.

## Modules

### Module 00: Basics
Introduction to C++, classes, member functions, and basic concepts.

### Module 01: Memory allocation
Pointers to members, references, and switch statements.
[Subject PDF](01/subject/subject.pdf)

### Module 02: Ad-hoc polymorphism
Operator overloading and orthodox canonical class form.
[Subject PDF](02/subject/subject.pdf)

### Module 03: Inheritance

### Module 09: STL

## Compilation

Each module can be compiled using the provided Makefile. Use the following command in the respective module's directory:

```
make
```

## Usage

After compilation, you can run the executable for each exercise as specified in the respective module's subject.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into modules (00 to 09), each containing multiple exercises. Each exercise has its own directory with source files and a Makefile. The subject PDFs for each module can be found in the `subject` directory within each module.

## Note

This project follows the C++98 standard as per the subject requirements.
